                "In Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower, the protagonist, a Black teenager named Lauren Olamina,  develops a belief system called Earthseed. “The ultimate destination, Lauren argues, is for humans to ‘take root amongst the stars’ — to develop a more liberating framework for community and care. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Contemporary astrology, I believe, continues a tradition in which Black people have looked to the universe and its wonders to circumvent the kind of Enlightenment logic whose ultimate end led to our enslavement and denigration.”

                Tarot is not fortune telling. Tarot is secret revealing. Tarot is a mirror.

                This card could also be called The Celestial Mandate -- that which refers us back to our reason for being, our mission in this lifetime. The Star reminds us that, in a sense, we are agents of divine will in our day-to-day lives. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If we let go of the idea that we are supposed to be in control, we can more easily notice and appreciate the synchronicities that are nudging us along. In this way, we become more conscious of the invisible helping hand, and we better understand our place within -- and value to -- the larger cosmos.

                The Star card reversed suggests that you are temporarily alienated from your brilliance and usefulness. You may feel clumsy, unskilled, at odds within your true nature. Perhaps you are forgetting your soul's purpose in this lifetime. Focus on your unique gifts and talents -- their source is divine. It's your job to learn how to apply them in any situation your life offers you.
