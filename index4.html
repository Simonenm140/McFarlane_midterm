            The ‘‘native man with donkey’’ was a stock character in many photographic representations of the Anglophone Caribbean taken during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The icon had been imprinted on numerous photographs and postcards since the start of the tourism industry in the 1890s, in an effort by the colonial government and tourism interests to constitute a new idea of Jamaica. 
            <br>
            <br>
            More than a century later, the man at Dunn’s River Falls made his living by transforming himself and his donkey into this age-old image. In this process the decades-old ‘‘man and donkey’’ icon continued to proliferate in the visual economy of representations that imaged the island both locally and abroad.
